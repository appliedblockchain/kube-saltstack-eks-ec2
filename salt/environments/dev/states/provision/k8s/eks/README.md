# EKS Provision State

# Executing
Executing `EKS` state generates the corresponding *HCL*. Since this is a sensitivy operation we should always intervene when changing infrastructure with code.

To execute the state simply run

```
$ salt-call state.apply provision.k8s.eks.latest pillar='{"client_id":"applied_blockchain"}'
```

**Note:** Replace `client_id` with the appropriate value.

# Outputs
All the files generated by the state, terraform plans, cloud-init, and so on are stored, by default (to change this change the `defaults.yaml` in `provision > tools` state), in `/tmp/provision/<client_id>`. Binary tools like `terraform`, `kubectl`, etc are installed at `/tmp/provision/bin`.

After executing the state you should go into the client folder `/tmp/provision/<client_id>` this folder and proceed with the *terraform workflow*

```
../../tools/terraform init
../../tools/terraform plan
PATH=$PATH:../../tools/ terraform apply/destroy
```
**Note:** The last command needs to set the path for terraform to find `aws-iam-authenticator` binary.

# Clean Up

Don't forget to clean up the output folder after you're done. By default it sits at `/tmp/provision/<client_id>`
